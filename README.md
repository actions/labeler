# Pull Request Labeler

Pull request labeler triages PRs based on the paths that are modified in the PR.

**Caveat:** This only works when the PRs come from inside same account/organization. (if the PR is from a forked repo, like is commmon in many OSS projects, this action will not work due to lack of permissions).

## Usage

### Create `.github/labeler.yml`

Create a `.github/labeler.yml` file with a list of labels and [minimatch](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch) globs to match to apply the label.

The key is the name of the label in your repository that you want to add (eg: "merge conflict", "needs-updating") and the value is the path (glob) of the changed files (eg: `src/**/*`, `tests/*.spec.js`)

#### Basic Examples

```yml
# Add 'label1' to any changes within 'example' folder or any subfolders
label1:
  - example/**/*

# Add 'label2' to any file changes within 'example2' folder
label2: example2/*
```

#### Common Examples

```yml
# Add 'repo' label to any root file changes
repo:
  - ./*
  
# Add '@domain/core' label to any change within the 'core' package
@domain/core:
  - package/core/*
  - package/core/**/*

# Add 'test' label to any change to *.spec.js files within the source dir
test:
  - src/**/*.spec.js
```

### Create Workflow

Create a workflow (eg: `.github/workflows/labeler.yml` see [Creating a Workflow file](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file)) to utilize the labeler action with content:

```
name: "Pull Request Labeler"
on:
- pull_request

jobs:
  triage:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/labeler@v2
      with:
        repo-token: "${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}"
```

_Note: This grants access to the `GITHUB_TOKEN` so the action can make calls to GitHub's rest API_
